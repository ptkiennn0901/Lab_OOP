- What class should implement the Comparable interface? => Media
- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we
want? => implemented in submitted code.
- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this
Comparable interface approach? => No, the Comparable interface only allows for one natural ordering. The ordering defined in the compareTo() method becomes the default ordering for that class.
- Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this? => implemented in submitted code.
