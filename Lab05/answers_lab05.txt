- The Aims class must be updated to handle any exceptions generated when the play() methods are
called. What happens when you donâ€™t update for them to catch?
=> When a PlayerException is thrown, if there is no try-catch block or an appropriate throws declaration, the program will terminate abruptly if the exception is unhandled. Besides, the program's flow is interrupted, and it does not return to the caller gracefully. Any statements after the point where the exception is thrown will not execute. The exception's stack trace will be printed to the console, providing details about the error, such as the type of exception and where it occurred in the code.
